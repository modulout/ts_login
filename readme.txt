With the TS login plugin, your users can log in or/and register from the front page (not needed to go to wp-admin anymore).

== Description ==

With the TS login plugin, your users can log in or/and register from the front page (not needed to go to wp-admin anymore). A simple widget is added, but you can add a class for login and a class for registration on any website element. The plugin is working with the latest WordPress version and is fully customizable. You can change colors in wp-admin to have your website look-alike feel.

There are also 3 login/register options: basic (only login or/and register form), the image on top (login or/and register form with image on top), and image on the left side (login or/and register form with image on the left side). All 3 options are fully responsive.

Google reCAPTCHA v3 is also available and you can use it with your site and secret key. By default this option is disabled.

Bootstrap library and Font-Awesome library are included.
