With the TS login plugin, your users can log in or/and register from the front page (not needed to go to wp-admin anymore). A simple widget is added, but you can add a class for login and a class for registration on any website element. The plugin is working with the latest WordPress version and is fully customizable. You can change colors in wp-admin to make it like your brand.

## Installation

1. Upload the ts_login directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or install through WordPress admin installer (wp-admin -> plugins -> add new)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit colors setting in wp-admin -> TS Login -> config
