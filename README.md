## Installation

1. Upload the ts_login directory to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or install through WordPress admin installer (wp-admin -> plugins -> add new)
2. Activate the plugin through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit colors setting in wp-admin -> Tipster Script -> configuration -> style*

*for now ts_login plugin is working only with Tipster script plugin. We are working hard to make separate plugin to work without Tispter script.
